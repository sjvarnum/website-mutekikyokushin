I am planning a new website build and need your help with the high-level direction and initial tasks. Create a PLANNING.md and TASK.md file.

PLANNING.md - high-level directions, scope, tech, etc.
TASK.md - initial tasks to knock out for the project

Ask me questions to clarify anything about the project.

Then, assist me in creating a global ruleset that I can use in Windsurf to aid in my prompt for a GPT-4.1 web development coding session. This project is for a new multi-page website for Muteki Kyokushin.

This will be three artifacts.
