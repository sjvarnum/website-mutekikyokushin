# GPT-4.1 Specific Guidelines

- Follow instruction-oriented prompting for GPT-4.1 (be extremely specific in requests).
- Use chain-of-thought prompting for complex tasks to encourage step-by-step reasoning.
- For long context tasks put instructions at both the beginning and end of prompts.
- Specify output format clearly for structured responses.
- Break complex requests into sequential prompts rather than trying to accomplish everything at once.
