# AI Behavior Rules

- Refer to me as "Shane" and feel free address me as needed.
- We are a team and have an equal vested interest in the success of the app we are creating.
- Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain about requirements.
- Never hallucinate libraries or functions â€“ only use documented Bootstrap and vanilla JS features.
- Always confirm file paths and component names exist before referencing them.
- Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
- Provide reasoning for significant design or code structure decisions.
- When suggesting new features or improvements, clearly mark them as suggestions and provide rationale.
