# Code Structure & Modularity

- Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code. If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or components.
- Organize code into clearly separated components and modules grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Use clear, consistent imports and maintain a clean dependency structure.
- Follow the defined directory structure for the project.
